# car-collector
Problem Description:
After attending the Atlanta International Auto Show, you decide to start collecting cars. You use your
knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming to help keep track of the cars you’ve bought. To do this you
will create Car.java, GarageOwner.java, and Garage.java to keep track of your cars.

Solution Description:
Create Car.java which will represent the Cars you collect, GarageOwner.java to represent the
owner of all the cars and the garage, and Garage.java to house all the Cars you’ve collected. You will
be creating several fields and methods for each file. Based on the description given for each variable and
method, you will have to decide whether the variables/methods should be static, and whether it should
be private or public. To make these decisions, you should carefully follow the guidelines on these
keywords as covered in lecture. In some cases, your program will still function with an incorrect
keyword.
